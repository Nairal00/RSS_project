# Code Checklist

When checking code, look for:

## Security
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Sensitive data exposure

## Performance
- N+1 query problems (running one query per item instead of one query for all items)
- Unnecessary loops or computations
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations

## Maintainability
- Function length (flag functions > 50 lines)
- Code duplication
- Missing error handling
- Unclear naming

## Output Format
Provide issues as a numbered list with severity:
- [CRITICAL] - Must fix before merge
- [HIGH] - Should fix before merge
- [MEDIUM] - Should address soon
- [LOW] - Nice to have
